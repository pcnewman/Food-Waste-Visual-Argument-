# Food-Waste-Visual-Argument-
I decided I wanted my topic to be about food waste.  This is something that I witness everyday in Oakland, along with various other forms of waste.  I want people to think about the things that they waste.  This ad is targeted towards a younger audience who is maybe learning about food waste for the first time.  It is important to start early and build eco-friendly habits.  I took a colorful and lighthearted approach to the project to get my message across. I started by first presenting the problem of food waste and using the pies in the pie chart presented the breakdown of where food is being wasted in America. Then I wanted to include tips on how to improve the situation.  These are tips that anyone can use and could even help you save a little money! Hopefully there is something in it for everyone!

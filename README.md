# Food-Waste-Visual-Argument-
I decided I wanted my topic to be about food waste.  This is something that I witness everyday in Oakland, along with various other forms of waste.  I want people to think about the things that they waste.  I also thought this type of project would allow for lots of visual punning.  In my preview I have slices of pie that line up with the amount of food wasted by consumers, producers,and distributors.  I made a pie chart each a different pie to show food and then an empty tin to show how we waste.  I was mostly just playing around with the software getting a feel for it.  I still have a lot of work to do to create a flyer that is to my liking.
